Recipe Website
=============

This is a recipe database website I wrote using AngularJS, Twitter Bootstrap,
JQuery, PHP and MySQL.

I originally wrote this using JQuery and doing the frontend code from scratch
as a way to learn AJAX. Recently I've been using AngularJS and Bootstrap and
used this as a way to strengthen my AngluarJS knowledge by converting it to the
angular way of doing things.


Setup
=====

Make a copy of the serverside/config.template.php to serverside/config.php and
fill in the variables for the host you are running it on.

Run the database creation SQL scripts into your database (serverside/database.sql).

Upload to your host.

Done!
